# 1. Mål og rammer

## 1.1 Bakgrunn

*See [project-description.md](./project-description.md)*

## 1.2 Prosjektmål

Develop a proof-of-concept SSI application, and use the proof-of-concept to discover and present strengths and weaknesses of the current SSI infrastructure, with a focus on interoperability. 

There are two key areas of interoperability:
1. Interoperability between different ledgers - where DIDs and VCs are stored.
2. Interoperability between different wallets - where the ownership of DIDs and VCs are prooved.

## 1.3 Rammer

The BSc project runs between `01.feb.2021` and `20.may.2021`.

The BSc project will be developed as an open source project on the DIN-Foundation's Github page here: https://github.com/DIN-Foundation/bsc-ntnu-2020/. 

See https://www.din.foundation/ for more info.


# 2. Omfang

## 2.1 Fagområde

The project is developed within the field of Self-sovereign-identity, aka SSI.

## 2.2 Avgrensing

The project is looking at interoperability of the current SSI-infrastructure. More specifically interoperability between wallets, and interoperability between ledgers.

To understand interoperability a proof-of-concept application will be developed. The proof-of-concept will implement one specific use-case of SSI. 

The proof-of-concept should implement the following parts of an SSI-workflow:
- Issuing a credential to a ledger
- Hold the credential in a wallet
- Proove ownership of a credential to a 3rd party.

A limited set of ledgers and wallets should be investigated:

### User story

*Disclaimer: The BSc has no affiliation with Statens Vegvesen at the moment of writing, and the story below is pure fantasy.*

The norwegian driver license issuer, Statens Vegvesen, is considering to start issuing it's driver licenses as verifiable credentials (VCs). Statens Vegvesen is not sure if verifiable credentials is the future yet, but are willing to try and dip it's toes in the water. Statens vegvesen will still issue credentials in the traditional way for the forseeable future.

What Statens Veivesen want is a proof-of-concept SSI-application which will issue, hold and verify driver-licenses. They are hoping that this will bootstrap SSI in Norway, as this will enable other individuals and organizations to start experimenting with holding and verifying a serious credential which actually is useful.

The proof-of-concept demonstrate why a driver license as a verifiable credential should be considered on par, legally speaking, with traditional driver licenses.

Statens Vegvesen wants the application to follow open standards which will enable the application to be agnostic about where and how credentials are issued, stored and verified. In other words Statens Vegvesen want to avoid the application to be locked to a specific ledger and a specific wallet.

- Beskrive gruppa sin måte å følge modellen på

## 4.2 Plan for statusmøter og beslutningspunkter i perioden

We have planned 2 weekly meetings, 1 with supervisor and 1 with product owner.

- Product owner meeting: Tuesdays @ 12:30
- Supervisor meeting: Tuesdays @ 13:00

Participants of these meetings have received invites by email, to make it easy to add the scheduled meetings to their respective calendars.
