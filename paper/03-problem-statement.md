# 3. Problem statement
## 3.1 Motivation

DIN is an ideal organization, which advocates SSI in a nordic context. DIN has ordered a proof-of-concept application to be developed for demonstration purposes, to showcase real-world application of SSI technologies. DIN wants the proof-of-concept to feature well-known governmental institutions in Norway, to make it easy for people to understand and contextualize how SSI-tech can improve the lives of everyday people, in everyday situations.

## 3.2 Goals

1. Present and demonstrate an application which solves a real-world SSI-problem in a Nordic Context.
2. Develop the application as an open-source project, on behalf, and in the name of, the DIN-Foundation.
3. Engage with the broader DIF-community during development.


## 3.2 User story

The following user story was devised at the beginning of the project, to serve as the concrete problem, which the implementation should try to solve:

```
The norwegian driver license issuer, Statens Vegvesen, is considering to start issuing it's driver licenses as verifiable credentials (VCs). Statens Vegvesen is not sure if verifiable credentials is the future yet, but are willing to try and dip it's toes in the water. Statens vegvesen will still issue credentials in the traditional way for the forseeable future.

What Statens Veivesen want is a proof-of-concept SSI-application which will issue, hold and verify driver-licenses. They are hoping that this will bootstrap SSI in Norway, as this will enable other individuals and organizations to start experimenting with holding and verifying a serious credentials which actually are useful.

The proof-of-concept may demonstrate, that a driver license as a verifiable credential could be considered on par, legally speaking, with traditional driver licenses.

Statens Vegvesen wants the application to follow open standards which will enable the application to be agnostic about where and how credentials are issued, stored and verified. In other words Statens Vegvesen want to avoid the application to be locked to a specific ledger and a specific wallet.
```
