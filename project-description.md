# Interoperability between identity wallets

## Background

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is the next disruption in the digital identity space. And at some point in the future, we all need to embrace it. With SSI, the individual identity holders can fully create and control their identity, credentials connected to themselves, all without being forced to request permission of an intermediary or centralised authority. And therefore not have to give control over how their personal data is shared and used. You can read about this concept in Christopher Allen’s post The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity (http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html).
Self-sovereign identity is starting to gain traction in the technological architectural space. There are several open standards from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and Hyperledger, which will be critical for this work.

Wallets has a lot of different capabilities such as explained here: https://youtu.be/MHXd4BhEBw0?t=313

- DIDs (Decentralized identifiers) by W3C: https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/
- VC (Verifiable credentials) by W3C: https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/
- Working standards under DIF working groups: https://identity.foundation/#wgs
- Hyperledger Aries is an open source effort by Linux Foundation to build components for the digital identity space such as cloud/mobile agent: https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries

## The BSc Project

The project ambition is to build a proof with the existing wallet standards, that it is possible to establish an open and interoperable identity wallet. Or even prove that this is not possible at this moment, because of the lack of certain standards. As part of the bachelor project team will develop a set of proof-of-concept reference implementations that can showcase the interoperability within the existing frameworks and tools that are already out there. Set together the needed pieces to prove that interoperability is possible. The reference implementation of the proof-of-concept, will prove that the user will be able to seamlessly respond to different service proof requests and issuance requests, and to be able to migrate credentials and other user-centric data stored in the users control.
The work will begin with existing open source frameworks, as well as closed source service providers with good developer portals for easy testing and verification. The project is language and platform agnostic. The biggest benefit in this is to showcase that the proclaimed panacea for digital identity, is actually possible. This work will rapport on hinders, benefits and possibilities with this ecosystem, and the importance of interoperability.

## Supervisors

The team will receive support from supervisors with expertise in SSI:
- Snorre Lothar von Gohren, Diwala CTO, has in-depth technical understanding of SSI, expertise in building identity services on top of SSI and Ethereum. Snorre has been attending and discussing in many of the working groups of DIF, W3C. Diwala is a DIF member.
- Abylay Satybaldy is a PhD student at NTNU working on SSI solutions, focusing on privacy protocols. His main PhD topic is in the area of true SSI models, interoperability and global adoption. 
- Mariusz Nowostawski, Associate Professor of Computer Science, NTNU, has extensive know-how in the area of distributed and decentralised computing. Prof.Nowostawski serves as an expert in the ISO TC307 Blockchain committee as well as consults with law enforcement agencies world wide in the context of identity and crypto currencies.
- This project will also gain the resources from the Nordic network for digital identity, https://www.din.foundation/​ , ​ which have a technolog
