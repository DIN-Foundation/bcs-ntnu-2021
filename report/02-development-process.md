## 2.3 Github source control

All source code was kept in a public open-source Github-repo, during the entire development. This made it easier to collaborate on the source code, because all participants had public access to all the work that was being done, from day one. 

### 2.3.x DID-CLI source code

### 2.3.x Playground mini-projects

Before implementing the DID-CLI, a lot of experimentation had to be done. This was done to learn, and iterate on smaller projects, before beginning on the big one. Most of the projects in the playground-folder are useless, but they served an important role as learning exercises.

## 2.5 Toggl Time Tracking

Tracking the hours was done in Toggl from day 1 (week 5), and throughout the project (end week 20). The hours were tagged with the following 6 categories:

- **Meeting** - Toggled when participating in a live meeting, or when writing meeting notes.
- **Organizing** - Toggled when organizing meetings and creating and updating Kanban tasks.
- **Writing** - Toggled when writing the  bachelor report.
- **Coding** - Toggled when coding in the playground mini-projects, or the DID-CLI main project.
- **Researching** - Toggled when reading specifications, papers, blog-posts, discussing with experts on the DIF and DIN slack/Discord channels, watching videos, reading previous bachelor reports, reading books, and more...
- **Lecture** - Toggled when participating in weekly lectures in the profprog-course, or one of the "lightning lectures" related to the bachelor-course.
