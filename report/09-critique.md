# 9 Critique

## 9.x Set up the bachelor template earlier

Most of bachelors in programming follow the same template, presented by Frode Haug in Lynkurs 2. This knowledge was aquired just 2 weeks before deadline. We should have known about this earlier. We would have known about it earlier, if we had watched Lynkurs 2 when it aired on onsdag 3.mars kl. 14.05-15.00 i Lille Eureka. This would have given an two extra months of working with the correct template, which would have been more productive. A big problem early in the report writing, was the lack of overview due to a template which was not suited for the kind of project.

## 9.x Had too little background knowledge about writing academic reports

I got the feeling that I should have known a lot more about writing academic papers, before starting on a bachelor project. What should be delivered in a bachelor project is not the code, it is the report. Some background theory about what a report is, and what is expected, and maybe even som practical experience with it, before starting on a bachelor project, would have been much more confortable.

## 9.x No automated testing

- Should have had automated testing
- Manual testing is tedious, error-prone, time-consuming.
- A proper framework for testing, should be part of the application architecture
