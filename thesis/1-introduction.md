# 1 Introduction

>@marni: Introduction - this should be relatively compact and short, stating the problem, why it is a problem, what this research/project is all about, etc. Do not deep-dive into anything, but it should be a quick introduction to everything surface-level, short and compact. Max 2-5 pages. After reading introduction the reader should be able to answer a question: "Do I want to read the WHOLE thing, PARTS of it, or NOTHING". So, you need to effectively "introduce" the reader to the domain, touch on all the main points, but, without DEEP dive.
