# 2 Background

>@marni: Problem statement and background (you may want to split these two into individual chapters too, depending how fat thatt chapter gets). This is where you describe the background, why the problem is what it is, and what existing solutions exist, how they try/fail to solve everything, and where your work fits in. You only PLACE it, where it fits, not describe it yet. Only research questions here.
