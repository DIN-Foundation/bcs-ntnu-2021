# 3. Problem statement

>@marni: Problem statement and background (you may want to split these two into individual chapters too, depending how fat thatt chapter gets). This is where you describe the background, why the problem is what it is, and what existing solutions exist, how they try/fail to solve everything, and where your work fits in. You only PLACE it, where it fits, not describe it yet. Only research questions here.

## 3.1 What is the problem we are trying to solve?

Maybe the most important question in any engineering endeavor. In this project it has proven to be the most difficult question to answer as well. SSI is an evolving space, where many important pieces are still up in the air. We can not solve everything, so another question is: Where do we even begin?


## 3.2 What problem are DIDs trying to solve?

From [did-use-cases] we get a list of 4 characteristics of dids:

""

1. **decentralized**: there should be no central issuing agency;

2. **persistent**: the identifier should be inherently persistent, not requiring the continued operation of an underling organization;

3. **cryptographically verifiable**: it should be possible to prove control of the identifier cryptographically;

4. **resolvable**: it should be possible to discover metadata about the identifier.

Although existing identifiers may display some of these characteristics, none currently displays all four.
