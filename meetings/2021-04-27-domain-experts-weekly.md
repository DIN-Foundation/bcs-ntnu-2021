## Log

- Talked about how to unblock writers block.
- The 05-implementation and 04-methodology chapters are the most concrete chapters.
- Should start with those first, then use those chapters to carve out the more abstract chapters later.
- The abstract, written at the very end, is like a movie trailer.
