## Chat log

```
from memory: ekstra column for "inbox", organising flow through board,  simplifying the transport, and potentially starting with copy-and-paste first, 3 layers of complexity: cmdlin + stdin/out, messaging bus, zeromq, libp2p.  postponing learning p2p just a bit (after initial demo perhaps),  did:p2p or did:kademlia as a future research AFTER bsc project
