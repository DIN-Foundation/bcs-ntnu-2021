## Log

**Jonas 12:34**
- The Kanban-board will be the default agenda for these meetings going forward. See Kanban boar at https://github.com/DIN-Foundation/bsc-ntnu-2021/projects/1
- We will go through what is on the board from right to left - Looking at "done" first, then "in-review", "in-progress", "todo" and "backlog".

**Mariusz 12:39**
- Need additional element to the user story. The identity provider is missing.
- Statens vegvesen is not a identity provider

**Jonas - Extra info**
- Who is the identity provider then?
- To issue a drivers license in Norway, Statens Vegvesen needs a "valid ID-paper" provided by the "holder". 
- Here is the list of valid ID's accepted by Statens Vegvesen: https://www.vegvesen.no/forerkort/ta-forerkort/gyldig-legitimasjon.

**Jonas 12:41**
- Project plan is a living document, and the user story will be updated with info about the identity provider.

**Snorre 12:45**
