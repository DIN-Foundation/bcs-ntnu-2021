## Discussion in DIF Slack

- No conclusion on the `subject !== holder`-verification-problem mentioned last time.
- A big conversation was initiated by my question, but difficult to ask follow-up questions.
- There was an agreement that something has to be specified, somewhere, but nothing has been done yet.

## Bachelor paper writing

- I am writing full-time from now.
- Implementation is considered feature-complete.
- Only small side-quests, which I can fiddle with, in-between paper writing, when I need a break from that.
- I will be writing the paper in the markdown documents here -> https://github.com/DIN-Foundation/bcs-ntnu-2021/tree/main/paper
- Evevntually the text will be copy-pasted into the fork of the NTNU Bachelor thesis template, hosted here -> https://github.com/DIN-Foundation/bcs-ntnu-2021-thesis
