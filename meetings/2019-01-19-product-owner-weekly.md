## Takeaways

### Developing a core project story

Assumption: To drive the project forward we need a story to tell. Solving a concrete problem, will highlight alot of the strengths and the weaknesses of the current SSI infrastructure.

### Project story (sketch)

The norwegian driver license issuer, Statens Vegvesen, is considering to start issuing it's driver licenses as verifiable credentials (VCs). Statens Vegvesen is not sure if verifiable credentials is the future yet, but are willing to try and dip it's toes in the water. Statens vegvesen will still issue credentials in the traditional way for the forseeable future.

What Statens Vegevesen is hoping is that if they start issuing drivers licenses as digital Verifiable Credentials, individuals and other institutions will be able to start experiment with using these VC's to verify claims from an individual if they are eligble to operate a given vehicle.

Many parties have shown interest in Statens Vegvesen's SSI bootstrapping efforts, including The Norwegian Police force, leasing companies, renting companies, car dealerships, insurance companies.


### Further questions to narrow down the scope of the description

- Which existing open source frameworks specifically?

- Which existing closed source service providers specifically?

- Which existing wallets specifically?


### Further questions to work on

- What does "Proof request" mean specifically?

- What does "Issuance request" mean specifically?

- What specifically does "interoperability" mean in the SSI context?

- How can we measure "interoperability"?
